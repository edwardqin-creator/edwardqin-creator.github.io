## Research Experience
**Image Registration Method Based on Evolutionary Computation**
Time: Aug 2020 – Mar 2022
Funding: Supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No.61772180)
Role: Person in charge (Team leader and the only undergraduate student in the group)
* Optimized the process of medical image registration with Evolutionary Computation.
* Improved genetic algorithm by simulating the breeding process of Chinese three-line hybrid rice.
* Achieved faster convergence speed and greater robustness. Published a paper at IEEE SMC2021.

**Extracting Concept Prerequisite from Network Resources**
Time: Jul 2020 – June 2022
Funding: Supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 61977021)
Role: Assistant Research (Assisted in the design and implementation of experiments)
* Innovatively explored from the two dimensions of Wikipedia and the course introduction.
* Dug out the primary dependencies between learning objects more accurately. Published a paper at
SEKE2021.

## Project Experience
**Alibaba Cloud Security WEBSHELL Text Detection**
Time: Sep 2022 – Now
Place: Alibaba Group, Wuhan, China
Role: Algorithm Analyst
* Deployed webshell text (malicious code) detection on the Alibaba Cloud platform.
* Based on BERT, we conducted large-scale automated text detection for massive data.
* Modified the algorithm through various methods, resulting in a final detection rate above 97%.

**Community resource integration application during the COVID-19**
Time: Jan 2020 – Jun 2022
Place: Institute of Software Hubei University, Wuhan, China
Role: Systems architect
* Aimed at difficulties in community management.
* Provided a platform for community residents to assist each other.
